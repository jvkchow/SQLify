This program acts as the popular music streaming platform, "Spotify" through a command-line interface. 

In this program, artists and users must create an account to access the program functionalities. After account creation, to access the program at later times, artists and users must log in with the correct username and password.

Artists may upload songs they created and gather data on their songs and themselves.
Such data includes finding their top fans and playlists.

Users may search for songs, playlists, and artists based on keywords where search results
provide additional information on the selected result. 
Upon song selection, users may listen to the song, see more information about it (which includes song title, song duration, song ID, artists that performed it), or add the song to a new or existing playlist.
